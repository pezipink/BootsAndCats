# Dragon Treatz

This is a SDL based game written for the F# Exchange 2016. You can see a talk on it [here](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/7356-dragon-treats-the-blending-of-the-paradigms)

The game is presently quite a mess and mostly rushed!  The idea was to show different approaches when using a non pure, multi-paradigm functional language.
